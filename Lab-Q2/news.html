            <b>Chandrayaan</b> is India's renowned lunar exploration program, managed by the <b>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</b>. 
            Launched in 2008, <i>Chandrayaan-1</i> was the program's inaugural mission. It achieved a significant milestone by detecting 
            water molecules on the Moon's surface, altering previous assumptions about its composition. <i>Chandrayaan-2</i>, <b>launched in 2019</b>, 
            featured an orbiter, lander, and rover. <i>While the orbiter continues to study the Moon's surface and composition, the lander's 
            attempted soft landing faced challenges and communication loss during descent, leading to the rover's inability to fully operate.</i> 
            Despite the setback, the orbiter has been operational and continues to send valuable data back to Earth even after nearly four years
            since the <i>Chandrayaan-2</i> mission. <b>Chandrayaan-3</b> -- consisting of an indigenous lander module, a propulsion module and 
            a rover -- is a follow-up mission to <i>Chandrayaan-2</i>. Its objective is to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing
            and roving on the lunar surface and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments. The Chandrayaan program underscores India's 
            growing capabilities in space technology and exploration. Having earned global recognition for its achievements and 
            contributions to lunar research, future missions under the Chandrayaan program are anticipated to yield further insights into 
            the Moon's mysteries and evolution.
